Open Imaging Colorimeter &amp; Photometer

Open Imaging Colorimeters and Photometers (OICP) are scientific-grade camera systems designed to make accurate and spatial measurements of luminance and chromaticity. OICP systems are calibrated to replicate human eyes' response to brightness and color.

The OICP systems can be used to design and qualify light-emitting elements and devices, such as cell phone display panels, AR/VR displays and any display devices that are visible to human eyes.
